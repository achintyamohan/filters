Misc notes taken from multiple sources, just to jot down stuff so I don't
forget it.

- In probablistic robotics, quantities such as sensor measurements, controls,
  and the states that a robot and its environment might assume are modeled as
random variables. These variables can take on multiple values, and they do so
according to specific probabilistic laws.

- Probabilistic inference is the process of calculating these laws for random
  variable that are derived from other random variables, such as those
modeling sensor data.
