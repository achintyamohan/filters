Misc notes taken from multiple sources, just to jot down stuff so I don't
forget it.

	- In probablistic robotics, quantities such as sensor measurements,
		controls, and the states that a robot and its environment might assume are
		modeled as random variables. These variables can take on multiple values,
		and they do so according to specific probabilistic laws.

	- Probabilistic inference is the process of calculating these laws for random 
	variable that are derived from other random variables, such as those modeling sensor data.

	- The typical definition of conditional probablity is that P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B)

	this is often interpreted as the conditional probablity of A given that B occurred.

	- The term P(A")B) in the conditional probability expression can be substituted for 
	P(B|A) * P(A)

	This now gives us Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

	- Total Probablitly Theorem- 
			P(A) = ∑P(A∩B)		for all B

	- The "expected value" of a random variable X (aka "expectation" or "mean") 
	with PMF pₓ(x) is
			E[X] = ∑xpₓ(x)	for all x

	- Variance of a random variable X-
			var(X) = E[(X-E[X])²] = E[X²]-(E[X])² = ∑(x-[X])²pₓ(x)

	- Standard deviation of random variable X-
			σₓ = sqrt(var(X))
